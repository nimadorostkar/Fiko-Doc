## Auto-Status Updates
The system automatically updates the viewing status based on progress percentage:
- 0% → "not_started"
- 1-99% → "in_progress"  
- 100% → "complete"

## File Storage
- Video files are stored in the `media/videos/` directory
- Unique filenames are generated to prevent conflicts
- Supported video formats: MP4, AVI, MOV, WMV, FLV, WebM, MKV
- File validation ensures only valid video files are uploaded

## Security
- All endpoints require authentication
- Users can only view/update their own progress
- Video streaming and downloads require authentication
- Admin interface provides oversight capabilities
